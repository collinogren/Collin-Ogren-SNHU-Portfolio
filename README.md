## CS 210 Project 3
- This program reads an input file of items sold at a grocery store and gives the user multiple options to display what was sold. It also writes a backup of the data.
- General stability and input validation are very good, as is text formatting.
- Enhancements could be made to the search feature to make it less picky. For example, making non-plural searches work as well as ignoring case.
- The most difficult part was just some parts related to inputs going between cin and getline() since you have to know when to ignore(). This was fixed by using resources to understand when to use ignore() for that purpose.
- One key takeaway is that key value pair data structures, like Hashmaps from Java or maps and unordered_maps from C++ are really, really useful.
- In order to promote maintainability comments, proper naming conventions, and single purpose classes were all used.
